# CARMABase
CARMA Base is the Docker base image for Dockerized releases and deployments of the CARMA Platform. All CARMA images should inherit from this and any dependencies of those images should be instaled in this base image to minimize system build time and final image size.

# CARMAPlatform
The primary CARMAPlatform repository can be found [here](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/carma-platform) and is part of the [USDOT FHWA STOL](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/)
github organization. Documentation on how the CARMAPlatform functions, how it will evolve over time, and how you can contribute can be found at the above links as well
