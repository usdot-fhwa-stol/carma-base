# This script is meant to generate .gcov files from source code built using code coverage compiler flags
# such that .gcno and .gcda files have been generated
# WARNING this script will remove any .gcov files which currently exist under the output directory argument 2. default=./coverage_reports/gcov/
#
# Parameters
# $1 The execution directory which this script will be run from. Generally this should be the catkin workspace with all source code and binaries below this directory
# $2 The output directory which the .gcov files will be written to
